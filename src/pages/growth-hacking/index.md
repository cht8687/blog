###Startup Success = Product + Growth + Revenue

1.Product 
  Make something people want

2.Growth
  Get lots of people to use the product

3.Revenue
  Get someone to pay for product or for access to users

###Good product comes first, growth second
- Investing in growth before you have a good product is a waste of resources
- It might seem to work initially, but reality catches up eventually

###Good product leads to Good Retention
- Retention curve for good products flattens out after a few months.

###You can improve retention by ...
- Getting feedback from exiting users to understand what'sworking and what's not.

- Finding a segment of users of whom your product has good retention.

- Geting users to experince core value (A-ha moment) sooner.
